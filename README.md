However, this version of the cipher works with all printable ASCII characters including letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, symbols and space: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII

Instead of creating a 5x5 table as the original cipher, which only allows space for the alphabet (25 letters), this version version creates a 5x19 table (95 characters).
